# Auction Action 

Hello! Thanks for checking out my little application. 

Auction action is a auction simulator application for between 2 and 9 players. Gather around a single keyboard and play through 3 (as of right now) auction types: Dutch, Penny and Vickrey. The goal of this project was to explore different types of auctions and to implement a console application using only the C# standard library. 

## TO DO
- [x] Create a random item generator (randomly select items from a long pre-programed catalogue)
- [x] Create the option to "appraise" an item for a small fee before bidding. By paying more to the appraiser you can get a close range on the value of an item. This creats an interesting "explore" / "exploit" tension. 
- [x] Create a winning condition where the player with the highest "true value" (a fake thing, but in this game consists of the true price of all their items and their remaining cash) of items wins.
